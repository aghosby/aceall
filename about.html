Ifeayo. She spoke French fluently and loved to dance, cook, paint and
make crafts. She was a super mum and was totally dedicated to her
family; she would take the boys to swimming and Spanish lessons on
Saturdays and always made time to look over their school work. In spite
of their ages at the time of her passing, she incorporated them into
activities around the house, like loading clothes in the washing machine,
measuring Dettol for bath water and putting bottles of water in the
fridge.</p>
                <p>She was a mother and sister to all who knew her and was loved by many.
She was admired as a highly intelligent, disciplined, strong woman who
continuously sought to make a positive impact wherever she was. She is
sorely missed and we take solace knowing that she rests in the bosom of
our LORD.</p>
