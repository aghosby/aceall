                    <p>Ayomide was a lovable person, warm and always willing to sacrifice for others. Always one to put a smile on the 
                    face of everyone, with her lovely dimples. Ayomide was willing to listen. We were really close in junior secondary school, 
                    we were besties! I recall us going home together back then. Ayomide was always there for me, a pillar of support. 
                    She was more than just a friend, she was a true friend and she always had an encouraging word for everyone.</p>

                    <p>I met your mother 27 years ago (that’s a really long time to know someone). We were both 10yrs old at that time and 
                    had just started our journey in Queen’s College, Yaba Lagos. We had both been pulled along with some other girls from our 
                    initial classes to form the would be notorious “T” arm. In Ayo’s very own words “Marinho joined us together in this great 
                    class”. Though we were considered a noisy bunch, some girls still stood out as genuinely good and well mannered. 
                    Your mother was one of them. She was always neat and properly dressed with nothing out of place.</p>
